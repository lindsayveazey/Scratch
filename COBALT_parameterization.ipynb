From the paper: \"This biologically labile fraction represents a large flux of carbon in the ocean, but with rapid turnover it constitutes a very small fraction (< 1%) of the ocean DOC inventory. A more biologically resistant fraction, produced in the euphotic zone at 15–20% of net community productivity (~ 2 Pg C yr-1; Hansell and Carlson, 1998b), is not immediately mineralized and instead accumulates in the surface ocean as biologically semi-labile DOC (Carlson, 2002; Hansell, 2002).\"\n",

    "  \n",
    "Given the inherent adherence of COBALT to the Redfield ratio (106:16; Redfield et al. 1963), we assumed that the lability of DON would correlate closely with measurements of C (e.g., Mann et al. 2012). Per Hansell et al. (2009), we assumed that 1% of fluvial DON could be classified as labile (i.e., biologically available); this estimate supports the assertion that labile DOM is subject to respiration or incorporation into riverine organisms or sediments (Wilson & Xenopoulous 2008). We assumed that 20% of DON could be classified as semi-labile (i.e., seasonal rates of decay) with the remaining 79% of all DOM classified as semi-refractory (i.e., decadal decay rates) (Hansell et al. 2009). We applied these assumptions to our determination of fluvial DOP as well."

    "  * [Cox et al. 2006](https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2006/324/m324p019.pdf): \"There were no obvious seasonal patterns in nutrient levels throughout the 3 yr CISNet sampling program at any of the 4 main study sites (www.hawaii.edu/cisnet). However, if the CISNet data were simply grouped into dry and wet seasons (dry: June to September; wet: October to May), we did find some significant differences in nutrient concentrations within Kāne‘ohe Bay. Phosphate and TDP were higher during the wet season (Table 3). Significantly higher nitrate concentrations during the wet season were only found at the NB site. In contrast, higher silicate concentrations during the dry season were found at the CB and SB sites (Table 3). The 0.2 μm chl a fraction was significantly higher in the dry season at the NB, CB and SB sites, but all other chl a fractions and the ratio of small to large chl a showed no significant dry versus wet season differences (Table 3). The microbial groups also showed significant differences, with higher concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria, Synechococcus, and picoeukaryotes during the dry season (Table 3). For larger cells, the only significant dry versus wet season differences occurred in dinoflagellate abundances at the SB and MP sites (Table 3b). Zooplankton showed higher biomass (AFDM) during the dry season in the large fraction at SB, and in the medium fraction at CB (Table 3).\"\n",

    "  * \"Due to high flushing rates, recovery times of bay waters from storm perturbations ranged from 3 to 8 d and appeared to be correlated with tidal range. Storm inputs have a significant effect on the water column ecosystem and biogeochemistry in southern Kaneohe Bay. The perturbations were only transient events and the system rapidly recovered to prestorm conditions.\" [Ringuet & Mackenzie 2005](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/F_Mackenzie/publication/227303537_Controls_on_Nutrient_and_Phytoplankton_Dynamics_during_Normal_Flow_and_Storm_Runoff_Conditions_Southern_Kaneohe_Bay_Hawaii/links/00b7d5293aa8ee5d17000000.pdf)\n",

However, the ammonium concentration is not altogether negligible, as suggested by the observations of Hoover (2002), but is not significant enough to include in the model calculations.\" [Tanaka & Mackenzie 2005](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/F_Mackenzie/publication/265088005_Ecosystem_behavior_of_southern_Kaneohe_Bay_A_statistical_and_modeling_approach/links/566f30a708aec0bb67bf0739.pdf)\n",
    "    * Note that ammonia is represented as nh4 in the model; technically, its chemical formula is nh3. I am *assuming* based on the lack of any mentions of ammonium whatsoever that nh4, specified as ammonia, represents ammonia.\n",
    "  *  [Cox et al. 2006](https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2006/324/m324p019.pdf): \"Pulses were characterized by an elevation in inorganic nutrient concentrations in the Bay close to the stream mouth. The general response was an increase in abundance of microphytoplankton and chl a after a 3 to 6 d lag following the nutrient increase. Picophytoplankton showed an increase in fluorescence per cell after a 12 to 24 h lag, probably related to a decrease in irradiance associated with turbidity in runoff. The Bay can act as source of dissolved inorganic nutrients and plankton for oceanic waters; however, planktonic populations in the Bay are primarily autochthonous and do not represent an oceanic source of nutrients for plankton consumers within Kāne‘ohe Bay.\""
