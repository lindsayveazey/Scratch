A more biologically resistant fraction, produced in the euphotic zone at 15–20% of net community productivity (~ 2 Pg C yr-1; Hansell and Carlson, 1998b), is not immediately mineralized and instead accumulates in the surface ocean as biologically semi-labile DOC (Carlson, 2002; Hansell, 2002).\"\n",

Per Hansell et al. (2009), we assumed that 1% of fluvial DON could be classified as labile (i.e., biologically available); this estimate supports the assertion that labile DOM is subject to respiration or incorporation into riverine organisms or sediments (Wilson & Xenopoulous 2008). We assumed that 20% of DON could be classified as semi-labile (i.e., seasonal rates of decay) with the remaining 79% of all DOM classified as semi-refractory (i.e., decadal decay rates) (Hansell et al. 2009).

    "within COBALT is modulating the remineralization rates of sinking organic material (Armstrong et al., 2002, see Section 5; Klaas & Archer, 2002). Production of biogenic and lithogenic minerals and its packaging into sinking detritus is linked to a variety of factors. For opal, the production of silica in sinking detritus (sidet) is linked to silicate uptake by diatoms (eqs. 22-23) and subsequent contributions to sinking material through either aggregation or zooplankton fecal pellets (eqs. 36, 41). Detailed knowledge of the controls on the production of detrital calcite and aragonite is limited (Iglesias-Rodriguez et al., 2002). Thus, as is the case for other recent models (Gangsto et al., 2008; Gehlen et al., 2007), COBALT relies on simple presumed scalings between the production of calcite/aragonite detritus, the calcite/aragonite saturation state, and the productivity of relevant planktonic ecosystem pathways for calcite/aragonite production. Calcite and aragonite solubility (co3_sol_calc, co3_sol_arag) is taken from the UNESCO 87 recommendation and splits the difference between the low-end solubilities of Mucci (1983) and Morse (1978) and the high-end solubility of Ingle (1975) and Plath (1980)...the carbonate ion concentration is determined from dic, alk, with ocean carbon chemistry and described in Dickson and Goyet (1994) with modifications by Millero (1995) . For calcite detritus, production is assumed to scale with omega_calc, the aggregation rate of small phytoplankton, and the rate at which small zooplankton are consumed by other zooplankton...The atmospheric deposition flux of lithogenic minerals was taken from Fan et al. (2006). Total riverine sources of lithogenic material were then inferred by subtracting of the atmospheric deposition flux from the global lithogenic sedimentation rate estimated in Dunne et al., (2007). This flux was then distributed across rivers in proportion to the flow rates. Lithogenic material (lith) is assumed to be converted into sinking particles via incorporation into fecal pellets during mesozooplankton filter feeding.\"\n",

    "  * [Cox et al. 2006](https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2006/324/m324p019.pdf): \"There were no obvious seasonal patterns in nutrient levels throughout the 3 yr CISNet sampling program at any of the 4 main study sites (www.hawaii.edu/cisnet). However, if the CISNet data were simply grouped into dry and wet seasons (dry: June to September; wet: October to May), we did find some significant differences in nutrient concentrations within Kāne‘ohe Bay. Phosphate and TDP were higher during the wet season (Table 3). Significantly higher nitrate concentrations during the wet season were only found at the NB site. In contrast, higher silicate concentrations during the dry season were found at the CB and SB sites (Table 3). The 0.2 μm chl a fraction was significantly higher in the dry season at the NB, CB and SB sites, but all other chl a fractions and the ratio of small to large chl a showed no significant dry versus wet season differences (Table 3). The microbial groups also showed significant differences, with higher concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria, Synechococcus, and picoeukaryotes during the dry season (Table 3). For larger cells, the only significant dry versus wet season differences occurred in dinoflagellate abundances at the SB and MP sites (Table 3b). Zooplankton showed higher biomass (AFDM) during the dry season in the large fraction at SB, and in the medium fraction at CB (Table 3).\"\n",

The general response was an increase in abundance of microphytoplankton and chl a after a 3 to 6 d lag following the nutrient increase. Picophytoplankton showed an increase in fluorescence per cell after a 12 to 24 h lag, probably related to a decrease in irradiance associated with turbidity in runoff. The Bay can act as source of dissolved inorganic nutrients and plankton for oceanic waters; however, planktonic populations in the Bay are primarily autochthonous and do not represent an oceanic source of nutrients for plankton consumers within Kāne‘ohe Bay.\""
