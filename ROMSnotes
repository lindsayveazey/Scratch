hioekg.h

*include/ : used for code customization; FORTRAN code

ocean.in - at the bottom there are glossary terms, as needed if I don't know what a variable does

roms_config.sh : compiling code (rmake utility; wrapper for make; it loads the roms_config.sh file and loads it)

spinup.sh

### In ocean.in:

# VARNAME in ocean.in should be set to a specific dir if it isn't in the hioekg-template dir.

# If we update a file, go into the hioekg-template dir and then type rmake. It will recompile.

# grid has 188 in the I direction, 88 in the J direction. I is divided into 8 sections, and J is divided into 8 sections.

      NTIMES == 720 # never touch this
          DT == 10.0d0 # largest possible value to use that keeps the model stable. this is the baroclinic timestep. Brian said "this seems low" and he would put it higher
     NDTFAST == 44 # barotopic mode- how many times do you want to run the barotopic mode for every one timestep in DT? here, this is a 10/44 sec = one quarter second timestep for the barotropic. Brian said "this seems really high"

# Once we get the model running, can we increase DT and increase NDTFAST?

# We can compute NDTFAST = sqrt(gH). We have both g and H. 


# ! Output history, quicksave, average, and diagnostic files parameters.

        NHIS == 360  # This says every 3600 seconds (we have a 10 sec timestep), we save a snapshot of the model. We care more about historys than avgs.
 	NAVG == 8640 # * 10 sec timestep = we get avgs every 86400 sec, or each day. Cumulative avgs.
