#### Powell lab activities &amp; beyond

This repo is a home for various notes, scripts, notebooks, and whatever other documents are useful for my regional-scale analysis using COBALT/ROMS.

The latter phase of my work- updates from October 2019 onward- detail my analysis of the results of two annual cycles (2013-2014) of COBALT. The repo is marked for a single type of document, but it's a mishmash of Python, XML, and plain old Word docs on occasion. 

- cobalt_notes.txt: A quick-reference doc of my variables.

- debugging.ipynb: Fixing the bugs and quirks I've encountered.

- diagnostic*: Text files using bash to explore diagnostic variables.

- early_spring_percent_difference.txt: Text file using bash to look at Feb-April trends.

- frinkraid_notes.txt: Server etiquette, file transfers, and general how-to.

- Granger_causality_tests*: Jupyter notebooks exploring Granger causality between key phytoplankton, key nutrient groups, and three zooplankton size classes.

- netCDF_extraction*: Protocol using python module 'xarray' to extract different resolutions of data from the model output.

- parameterization.ipynb: Parameterization protocol for the 2013 model.

- plots_R.ipynb: Plotting output data using R.

- prophet_models_plankton.ipynb: Creation of time series models using first 15 months of data and facebook Prophet to predict future trends (and then compare against known trends).

- river_figure.ipynb: A couple river time series plots.

- ROMS_COBALT_setup.ipynb: Setting up the first runs for the physical and coupled models.

- scratch.ipynb: A scratchpad of searchable, uncategorized lines of code.

- seapy_for_figures.ipynb: use of the 'seapy' module to visualize .nc files.

- seasonal_validation_full_procedure*.txt: The full protocol for 2013/2014 validation in terminal.

- sector_surface_extractions+movie_clips.ipynb: Sector/layer extracts using CDO, plus making GIFs.

- Stock_notes.odt: My notes on the global instantiation paper.

- tables.ods: For the paper.

- tuning.ipnyb: Validation notes.

- /etc: Notes for old projects that I can't quite toss yet.
