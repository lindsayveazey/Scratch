#### Powell lab activities &amp; beyond

This repo is a home for various notes, scripts, notebooks, and whatever other documents are useful for my regional-scale analysis using COBALT/ROMS.

The latter phase of my work- updates from October 2019 onward- detail my analysis of the results of two annual cycles (2013-2014) of COBALT.

The repo is marked for a single type of document, but it's a mishmash of Python, XML, and plain old Word docs on occasion. The Wild West of repos. Yeehaw.
