This repo is a temporary home for various notes, scripts, notebooks, and whatever other documents might be useful for a given project- primarily COBALT. Please see my forked "seapy" repo for a close look at the guts of the COBALT model.

The repo is marked for a single type of document, but it's a mishmash of Python, XML, and plain old Word docs on occasion. The Wild West of repos. Yeehaw.
