# "Three categories of DOM availability are defined (labile, semi-labile, and refractory) based on general timescales of biological utilization (Kirchman et al. 1993, Carlson and Ducklow 1995). By this definition, labile DOM is utilized on timescales of hours to weeks. Semi-labile DOM is utilized on timescales of months to years, and refractory DOM is utilized on timescales of centuries to millennia." (Davis & Benner 2007)

# "A small fraction (8.6%) of the stream water DOC was labile, travelling 238 m downstream before being taken up. The remaining bioavailable stream water DOC was semi-labile and transported 4.5 km downstream before being taken up. These uptake lengths suggest that the labile DOC is an energy source within a stream reach, while the semi-labile DOC is exported out of the reach to larger rivers and the downstream estuary, where it may provide energy for marine microbial communities or simply be exported to the oceans." (Kaplan et al. 2008)
