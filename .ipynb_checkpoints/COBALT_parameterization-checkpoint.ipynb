    "  * **oceanM*** is the executable file that is created.\n",
    "  * **varinfo.dat** is also created.\n",

    "    1. ``GRDNAME``: Change pathway to **hioekg-grid.nc**.\n",
    "    2. ``ININAME``: Change pathway to **his-ini-##.nc**. Note that the initialization file must contain the keyword “his”, or the script won’t be able to find it- this is an inherent ROMS oddity.\n",
    "    3. ``BRYNAME``: Change pathway to **hioekg-bry.nc**, the boundary conditions file.\n",
    "    4. ``CLMNAME``: Change pathway to **hioekg-clim-##.nc**, the climatology file.\n",
    "    5. ``SSFNAME``: Change pathway to **river-hioekg.nc**, the sources/sinks file.\n",
    "    6. ``TIDENAME``: Change pathway to **hioekg-tide.nc**, the tidal forcing file.\n",
    "    7. ``FRCNAME``: Change pathway to **frc-wrfo.nc**, the forcing file. Note that I can change ``NFFILES = #``, located a few lines above, to point to multiple forcing files. This will happen later, when COBALT is run.\n",
    "    8. ``DSTART``: Change to match the ## on **his-ini-##.nc**. Presently, **day2date.sh** and **date2day.sh** are in ``/nest``. These scripts translate dates and days. Example: ``date2day.sh 2011 1 1 → ##`` (translates to a day).\n",

    "5. **spinup.sh**\n",
