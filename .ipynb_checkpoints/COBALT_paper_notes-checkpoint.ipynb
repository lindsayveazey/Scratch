    "\n",
    "**1.** nlgz_2014 > nlgz_2013, especially during summer?\n",
    "\n",
    "*FF docs*: \"The zooplankton community (during May-July) was dominated by a particular size-class of predators (i.e., that prey on smaller larval fish), which could provide a 2-fold advantage for larger fish larvae as they could grow big enough to avoid being eaten (higher survival due to less predation) and subsequently feed on those abundant predators (enhanced growth & survival due to abundant prey resources). For example, chaetognaths are predators to many larval fish, but Butterflyfish (particularly Chaetodon kleinii, the species that settled in the millions to Molokini) are chaetognath specialists as larval/juveniles. Perhaps the spiny bodies require a bigger gape than chaetognaths possess - and as a result they experienced reduced predation. A peak in chaetognath abundance in coastal waters at the right time could provide this 2-fold advantage, as they would feed on smaller fish larvae - reach high densities - and provide good prey resource for larger fish larvae (such as Butterflyfishes).\" \n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** nsmz_2014 > nsmz_2013, especially during summer?\n",
    "\n",
    "*FF docs*: \"The zooplankton community was comparatively younger and of a smaller size-class (during May-June), which reduced the relative abundance of larger zooplankton predators  - allowing larger larval fish to escape predation, and subsequently provide them with abundant prey resources (as they could then feed on the smaller zooplankton predators). The Chl-a data could support this hypothesis: Axel recorded the lowest Chl-a values in 11 years in the region earlier this year. Thus, the lower than average Chl-a values suggest a delayed or retarded winter/spring phytoplankton bloom that would have certainly led to delayed/retarded growth of the zooplankton community.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This correlates with monthly mean Chl-a for all MHI. Kyle: \"I took a quick look at Aqua Modis Chl-a data. If you draw a rectangle around the main islands, and take mean Chl-a by month, then mean monthly Chl-a was lower in March-May 2014 than in the prior 11 years. And the other months in 2014 have been at or near the minimum seen in previous years. If you draw a larger rectangle that includes the northwestern islands, then Chl-a is abnormally low in April-May, but not so much in the other months.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notes*: Asked R. Coleman for species-specific data and publications in press.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** u, v 2014 > u, v 2013?\n",
    "\n",
    "*FF docs*: \"Oceanographic conditions that would favor these larvae:\n",
    "(1) Were there more favorable conditions further offshore that better swimming larvae would have had access to?\n",
    "(2) Were there faster currents that could have swept other less-capable swimmers away?\n",
    "\n",
    "This (movie clip) gives you some appreciation of the huge North Pacific warming over the past months. In January it was created by anomalous westerlies. The current warm banana situation is enhanced by the wind-evaporation SST feedback. Warm waters => low trade winds => weak evaporation => warmer waters.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** temp_2014 > temp_2013? The data shows this is true for the MHI. This may enhance the effect of some other trigger(s), but it isn't this alone, as the North Pacific was anomalously warm, but the insanely high spawning only occurred around the MHI.\n"
