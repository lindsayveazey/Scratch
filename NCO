## NCO (NetCDF Operators) notes
# http://nco.sourceforge.net/nco.html

# MERGE FILES: The simplest way to create the union of two files:

ncks -A fl_1.nc fl_2.nc # fl_2.nc is the union

# SIMPLE NUMERICAL OPERATIONS: Performs operations on variables of the same name in two different files:

ncbo --op typ='TYPE' 1.nc 2.nc storagefile.nc ..or...

ncadd 1.nc 2.nc 3.nc # Addition
ncdiff 1.nc 2.nc 3.nc # Subtraction
ncmult 1.nc 2.nc 3.nc # Multiplication
ncdivide 1.nc 2.nc 3.nc # Division

# Concatenating files

ncrcat 1.nc 2.nc 3.nc 4.nc 5.nc 1t5.nc

# Averaging across files 

nces: averaging fixed length variables from multiple files; performs a simple arithmetic average over the record dimension of all the input files, with each record having an equal weight in the average

nrca: averaging record variables from at least one file; performs a simple arithmetic average over the record dimension of all the input files, with each record having an equal weight in the average

# Interpolation

# Ex: multiply 85.nc by 3 and by -2 and add them together to make tst.nc:

ncflint -w 3,-2 85.nc 85.nc tst.nc
